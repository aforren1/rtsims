## Simulation of reaction times for various race models

Aiming to include:

### Within-trial variation
  - linear ballistic accumulators (LBA)
  - race model (independent random walks)
  - leaky competing accumulators (LCA)
  - mutual inhibition (some equivalency to LCA?)
  - See http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/362/1485/1655
 
### Between-trial variation
  - History effects
     - Appears that people have faster RT if trial n-1 was
       the same stimulus/response pair
     - Weighting based on recent history (e.g. if stimulus hasn't 
       occurred in awhile, greater P(choice)
  - Learning effects
     - Exponential & power law over blocks/days

### Between-individual effects
  - Random effects on any and all parameters
  - Gaussian (and t-distributed? Or is that overboard?)
